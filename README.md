### High Concept

Use leapmotion to rotate the whole scene in 3D space in order to connect the path in 2D space that the player is able to reach the finale.

### Features

•	Multiple level, with each level harder than the previous one

•	Player can use the leapmotion stick directly control the rotation of 3D scene, which consists of 3D blocks. No keyboard control needed.

•	What player sees on the screen is the 2D projection of the 3D scene, once the projection of two 3D blocks are close, we can consider they’re connected in 2D space, game character can pass through, which make it closer to the finale 

•	The game character will keep moving forward all the time, if you don’t toggle around the screen in time, character will either be blocked(if there’s a floating block ahead of it) or fall from the block(game over).

•	Each player will have 3 lives to play, but this will be adjusted as # of levels increases.

## #Genre

Illusion game similar as Monument Valley but use leapmotion as a controller for the game.

### Player Challenge/Motivation

Player need to toggle around the whole scene in 3D angles in order to connect the path in 2D space and reach the designated finale.

### Design Goals

Novel: a new way of controlling, instead of using keyboard or your physical touch on the screen(like iPhone).

Simple: easy to understand game rule 

Addictive: Since it’s level-driven, player would be addictive to the game in a sense that they want to unlock all levels in the whole game.
